###### Summary:
I really want to become a REAL web developer. At my 39 years old, I found an activity that at first was like a pleasant hobby.
I studied the basics in the online school "Solo learn", received electronic certificates of completion.
Recently completed the "freeCodeCamp" course - Responsive Web Design.
Any field of development is interesting for me.
